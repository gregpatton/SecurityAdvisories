### Vulnerability Details
Adobe RoboHelp Server is prone to cross-site scripting and SQL-injection vulnerabilities because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input. 

A successful exploit may allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

### Exploit
Attackers can exploit this issue via a browser.  A specially crafted URL could be used to create a cross-site scripting attack or SQL injection on RoboHelp Server 6 and RoboHelp Server 7 installations.

### Solution
The vendor has released a fix. Please see the references for more information.
