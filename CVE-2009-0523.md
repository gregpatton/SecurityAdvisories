### Vulnerability Details
Adobe RoboHelp Server is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

An attacker may leverage these issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks.

### Exploit
A specially crafted URL could be used to create a cross-site scripting attack on RoboHelp installations.  To exploit these issues, an attacker must entice an unsuspecting victim into following a malicious URI.

A specially crafted URL could be used to create a cross-site scripting attack against files generated by RoboHelp. This issue is remotely exploitable. 

A specially crafted URL could be used to create a cross-site scripting attack RoboHelp Server 7 and RoboHelp Server 6. An attacker would need to have access to the RoboHelp Help Errors log, or convince someone with access to the RoboHelp Help Errors log to click on a malicious URL, in order to execute the attack. This specific issue does not apply to RoboHelp 7 or RoboHelp 6 (non-Server releases).

### Solution
The vendor has released patches.
